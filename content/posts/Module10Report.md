I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week's reading, **I learned about the content modeling and how we can differentiate 
content type, content attributes and datatype about the content attributes.Moreover, I learned 
that datatypes are really useful in content management system.** *Without using proper datatype we can 
complete certain tasks effectively and efficiently.*

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
At this point in the semester, *I learned about conetent management systems like Hugo and WordPress about
how we can publish content and how we can change the themes and use the media file such as image, videos
etc.* **I learned how we can add hyperlinks in the post.**


I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Since I am working as a editor in the group, I know how established workflows works to complete certain 
tasks.**In order to complete the workflows everyone in  workflow must be careful completing thier tasks in time.**
In a workflow, editors write the main content, developers write the code for the content and administrator
write the overall report about the project.



I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
As we are learning more about Hugo and WordPress, **I know how things works in these two content management systems.
For example, how to post content, how to edit content, how to change the themes and how use markdown elements just 
to make post more attractive.** 

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
Whenever I feel confuse, I know where to find the help and resources. *I try to find information in the class readings, 
I even use google and youtube to find information about my need about the content management systems.*  **Moreover, I seek
helps from friends and professor whenever needed.**
