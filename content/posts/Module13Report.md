I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This week, **I learned about how content creator/managers make money through
different resources such as advertising, sponsors to create content, crowdfunding,
affiliated links, sell stuffs related to content and restrict access to content etc.
I believe advertising is a great way to pay content creator.** In addition, this week
I learned about the WordPress permissions and how it can helps to maintain the security
of any WordPress websites. By using file permission, we can set up who can read, write
and execute the content that we have in our WordPress websites.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
We know **one content management system can be better for one specific purpose while other
can be better for different types of content management.** *This semester we are mostly dealing 
with Hugo and WordPress CMSs.* This week I learned how content creators can make money by using
different resources such as ads, affiliated links, restrict access to content etc.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Since I am working as a editor in a group,**I learned how to choose specific and relevant topics
for any post. This week I worked as a co-editor and did edits of the content.** I know, we can have
multiple editors, developer and adminstrator depending upon the needand requirements.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using Hugo and WordPress content management systems, **I can use these two CMSs
to create post, add image, links and changes the themes.** Moreover, I can add plugins and extensions 
the way I want from avalable options.*In addition, I learned how content creator can add advertisements 
by using plugins like AdSanity, AdRotate etc. in order to make money.* Further, I learned how we can set 
up file permissions to increase the security of WordPress websites. We can manage who can read, write and 
execute the files that way we want.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
Whenever I need help, while using CMSs, I do find resources in YouTube and in Google.
Sometimes, I ask with friends and professor, if I got stuck in anything.**I use available readings that we
have for every week for additional supports.**
