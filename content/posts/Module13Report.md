I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This week, **I learned about how content creator/managers make money through
different resources such as advertising, sponsors to create content, crowdfunding,
affiliated links, sell stuffs related to content and restrict access to content etc.
I believe advertising is a great way to pay content creator.**

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
We know one content management system can be better for one specific purpose while other
can be better for different types of content management.*This semester we are mostly dealing 
with Hugo and WordPress CMSs.* 

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Since I am working as a editor in a group,**I learned how to choose specific and relevant topics
for any post.In addion,I learned that communication is must to complete the workflows in a timely
manner.** I know, we can have multiple editors, developer and adminstrator depending upon the need
and requirements.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using Hugo and WordPress content management systems, **I can use these two CMSs
to create post, add image, links and changes the themes.** Moreover, I can add plugins and extensions 
the way I want from avalable options.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
Whenever I need help, while using CMSs, I do find resources in YouTube and in Google.
Sometimes, I ask with friends and professor if I got stuck in anything.**I use available readings that we
have for every week for additional supports.**
