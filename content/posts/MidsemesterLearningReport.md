I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this class, I learned what the content is, how we can create contents, how we publish the content. In addition, I learned about the workflows, and different roles each person performs in a workflow. I got to learn about the editors, administrators, site planner, and stakeholders and their specific roles. For instance, I am working as a editor in my group up until now, so I am learning to write effectively. I got to know how typos and grammatical errors affect our content as a whole, and I am trying to improve on. Since we are using Hugo and WordPress sites as our content management systems for our class, I know how to publish the content in both of this CMSs, and how to change the themes in each CMS.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
I learned that there are different content management systems, and we can choose any specific CMS based on our need and abilities to navigate that CMS. As I know from the different reading from the class that there are some content management system that requires more knowledge about code and coding in order to use multiple features available in the content management system. People can use one CMS for blogging, while they can use different CMS for business purpose and marketing. 


I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
I learned about workflows and how each person in a workflow work in order to complete the project that they are working on. I got to know that in a workflow, we usually have site planner, editors, administrator, developers, stakeholders. In addition, we may have sub editors and sub developers depending upon the need. Each person has specific role to complete in a workflow, and content stays in one place for specific time, so everyone needs to contribute to complete the project on time. I learned that editor writes the main content and developer writes the code and works for better presentations, and administrators do write the final reports about the project roles performed by everyone in a workflow.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are learning Hugo and WordPress sites as our content management systems, I easily navigate these two CMSs and create post, edit post, change themes depending upon our need. To some extent I know how we can add image and video files in a post in order to make posts more effective and understanding. I got to know about HTML and CSS codes that we can use in different CMSs.


I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
After taking this class, I learned more about the overall concepts about the content management systems and I can navigate the content management systems such as Hugo and WordPress and performs different tasks like creating post and editing it. Moreover, publishing it. I learned how to use images and videos in a post depending upon the need. I have learned about these CMSs using different websites that I got from the class. Moreover, I use resources such as class reading, help from friends and professor whenever needed.
