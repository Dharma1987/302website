I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This week I learned how difficult it is to differentiate different content management 
systems. **I think there is not good or bad content management system, but the prority 
should be what works better than the other for any specific purpose.** For instance,
one content management system may need in depth knowlege about coding while other may be 
as easy as drag and drop the content in order to create in content managemet systems.


I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
This week I got chance to **explore other content management systems that are out there
such as Wix and Django.** I got some idea about how these content management sytems are 
different. Moreover, I learned how Wix is somewhat similar to WordPress. For instance,
how we can choose themes, create the content and how we post.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
This week working as a editor I got chance to learn about how editor works and what we 
should consider while choosing topics for our post. I know how other people works in an
establised workflows. *I hope I'll get chance to work as developer and administrator role
in later in the semester.*


I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using Hugo, and WordPress as primary tools for our purpose of content 
management system. I can diffentiate how each content management works to some extent.
Foe instance, how to edit the posts and how we can create posts in Hugo and WordPress. 
*I know there is more to learn about these two content management systems.*


I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
Since I am leaning these new things and I'm enjoying it. I know where to
get help if I need any.**I can find resources such as friend's help and 
professor's help whenever I needed.** Moreover, I can find resources online as well.
