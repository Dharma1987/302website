I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week's reading,**I learned about the meuning and how implicit
and explicit menuing are different with each other.** Moreover, *I learned
content aggregation and different content shapes such as serial, hierachical,
network,tabular and relational content.* **I learned about primary content geography 
and secondary content geography.**

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
I can differntiate and compare content management systems based on the features that
**I learned this week such as content aggregation,  different content shapes such as
serial content, hierachical content, network content, tabular content and relational
content.** For example,*based on my understanding about content aggregation and content
geography I believe Hugo site is somewhat hierachical content and Wordpress is somewhat
combination of hierachical and serial content.*

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Being as a editor, in the group, **I can differential the roles and specific tasks that each
person has to complete such as editors write the main content, developer writes the code and 
administrator writes the overall report about the project.** We can have additional editors, 
developers and administrator based on our need.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using Hugo site and WordPress site as our content management systems,**I can do 
some of the stuffs that we have learned in the clss such as creting post, editing post, using
markdown elements, changing themes, and using media files such as images and audio files.**

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
I know where to find help whenever needed. For instance,*I ask with friends and professor whenever I need help.
Moreover,**I can find related information in the class reading and I can even use google and YouTube as an additional 
resources to learn about the stuffs that I need for this class.**
