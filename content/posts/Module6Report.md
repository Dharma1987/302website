I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content manage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This week I learned how WordPress site actually works. I did create
the draft post in WordPress and used some html tags in my post 
and they all worked fine as they should. *In addition, I worked as a editor
for my group, I did write the content for our blog post.*


I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------

Since, we are going to do actual assignment that is blogpost 
in group. I learned how exactly different people work to create
and publish the content by using workflows. I mean this week I got
real experiance about using the WordPress site to complete our task.
In short, editor will write the content, developer will write some code 
for better presentation and adminitrator will write the report about 
overall performance of each individuals in a group.


I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------

**This week, as an editor in my group, I did write the content for the post**
and even knew how other people will complete their task realted with their roles.
I learned how developer edit the content by using markdown elements
and some html tags. I'm excited to learn more about other possible
tools that we can use to create our post better.


I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

**This week I got the real experiance of using WordPress and applying different tools 
that this site offers.** I learned how other people in a group will do their task
in order to achieve the task.I learned cetain things such as how to create post 
and knew how multiple people can contribute to the same tasks using different 
technologies available.


I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------

**So far, I'm doing good using resources for self- directed learning. I followed 
the instruction of the professor to navigate WordPress site.** I learned some cool features
that WordPress offers. If I got confused about anything I know where to get help and
additional information about my need.
