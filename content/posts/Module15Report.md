I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
This week,**I learned about how to give effective peer feedbacks by following three stepts that
we had dicussed in the class earlier such as set the standard, describe the situation and 
provide the next steps.** Moreover, as an extra project,**I learned about the WordPress themes and how they 
change the overall look of the page. Different themes help for better presentation needs.**

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
Since, we are learning about the two content management systems such as Hugo and WordPress.*I can use 
describe and compare these two content management systems in terms of content presentation, uses of plugins
and extensions, presentations of contenet and overall looks of both sites etc.*

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Working as a editor for the group,**I learned how to write effective posts for the assignments.
I learned how important is to follow the workflows to complete the tasks or project. If anyone in the group did 
not complete their tasks as expected than It will create probles in the workflows and creates delays to complete 
the project in time.** Moreover, *communication is a must to complete the workflows in time. In general, in a workflow,
we have editors, developers, administrators, site planners depending upon the needs.*

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This week,**I learned how to use different themes in the WordPress site. Moreover, I learned how different themes
changed the overall presentation of the websites. We can use multiple themes depending upon particular needs.
In addition, I can use differnt extensions and plug-ins to increase the functionalities of the content management
systems.** *I learned how we can create additional pages and create posts in both content management systems.*

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
While learning about different features of contenet management systems, *if I got confused about anything I use 
different resources such as lectures note.* Moreover, I use resources from different websites and YouTubes related
to content management systems.**In addition, I asks with the professor and friends for additional support whenever 
needed.**
