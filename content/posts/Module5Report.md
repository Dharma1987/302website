I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content manage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week's reading, **I learned how presentation and content
is different in content management system.** In additio, I learned
how I can use different hugo themes in my hugo sites as I want. I 
even learned how small change in CSS file can create in presentation.
This week I learned how I can change the theme color and how I can change
the title of my hugo site. Lastly, I learned how to add social media
links in my hugo site page.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
I can describe what content is, and how we can manage it
using available resources that we have. I can differntiate 
between *(web) content management and content management
system*.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
I can define what workflow is and how we can complete the
task using workflow that we create. For example, I have changed my hugo
website theme and learned how it happened. I guess it is editorial part
if we talk in terms of workflow. I guess we havent't started using all elements 
of workflows in a single real group assignment, but I'm excited to learn more about it.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This week I learned more stuffs relating to existing technologies. For example,
I learned how to change the themes as I want based on my need. *I learned how even small change in 
CSS file can create awesome presentation.* I feel comfortable using hugo, github these days.
    
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
So far I am doing good using resources for self-directed learning.
I know how to get help if I need any. **Every week I follow the professor's
direction on how to complete assignment, and I am learning new thing everyweek.**
