I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week's reading,**I learned about some extensions and plug-ins that
we can use in Hugo site and WordPress site.** By using extensions and plugins we
can do tasks easily and effectively. The main purpose of using plugins and
extensions to make work easier while working in any content management systems.

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
As we know all content management are not for same purpose. We can use one content
management system for one specific purpose and other content management system for
other purpose. While working on different content management systems, we can use 
multiple extensions and plug-ins to make things easier.Different content management 
systems may have different plug-ins and extensions that we can use to complete 
certain specific tasks.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Working as an editor in a group, I learned how to choose specific and relevant topics
for any post. I can about how to present ideas in content in effective ways. In addion,
I learned that communication is must to complete the workflows. I know, we can have 
multiple editors, developer and adminstrator depending upon the need and requirements.

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using Hugo site and WordPress site as our content management systems,**I can do 
some of the stuffs that we have learned in the clss such as creting post, editing post, using
markdown elements, changing themes, and using media files such as images and audio files.**

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
Since we are learning about the content management systems from the beginning of the semester, and
learned about two content managemnet system, Hugo site and WordPress site. Whenever, I need help
while using these CMSs, I do find resources in YouTube and google as well. I usuallyasks with friends
and professor if I got stuck in anything. I use available readings that we read every week for additional 
help.
