I can identify and define key concepts in web content management. I think I'm still pretty new to this and we haven't covered on this topic that much yet.
I can describe and compare-contrast management systems. I thinnk we haven't covered this part yet in the class. 
I can manage content using established workflows. I think we haven't covered much about this yet, but with proper guidence I can manage. 
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. For instance, I'm learning how to use microsoft teams, github, netlify, and hugo website.
I can find and use resources for self-directing learning. For instance, I uses professor's notes for creating this hugo website and to learn other technologies as well. Moreover, I uses youtube tutorials to learns about anything if I got stuck.
This is a sample post. You can copy the text of this post to create new posts for your weekly learning reports. Pay close attention to the format of the text in this fileâ€”changing it too drastically will cause the report to not show up.
