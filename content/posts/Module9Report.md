I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week's reading, **I learned about how to provide effective feedbacks
to peers and how we can be effective in writing using provided rubrics about
the assignments.** *I believe effective peer review or any other kind of review 
definitely helps for better understanding of the materials or assignments that we create 
in our content management systems.* I learned **how we can give effective feedback using three
steps such as establishingthe standard, describing the situations and by providing the 
next steps for improvements.** Overall, I am learning all aspects of different content
management systems.**

I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
At this point in the semester, **I can differentiate and compare different 
content management system, and how one content mangement can be better choice for
certain tasks, and how other can be suitable for other tasks.** *For instance, we
can easily post and edit contents as well as use media files such as image and 
videos for more clear understanding in WordPress while in Hugo we need to complete 
multiple steps in order to achieve same tasks.* I got to know that there are so many 
other CMSs out there that we can use based on our specific needs.

I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
Working as a editor in a group, **I got to know how to work as an editor and how it can be 
helpful for writing contents and improve on.** Moreover, I do know how everyone in the workflows 
works in order to get the tasks done.  *I believe communication is a key for an effective workflows.
Sometimes it might be challenging if we do not communicate with in the group.*

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Since we are using WordPress and Hugo sites as our content management system, **I am quite comfortable 
and familiar using these content management systems. For instance, publishing post, editing the post etc.**
Last week, we even got chance to learn about other content mangement system such as Wix, Shopify, Django
CMS to name a few.

I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
If I have confusions about anything in the content mangement systems.**I know how
to get help from CMS websites and other dedicated websites about the content mangement 
systems.** In addition,*I always asks the professor if I found anything confusing about the 
different features avilable in different CMS.*
