I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content managment.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
From this week I learned how we can select the content management systems 
that is suitable for our need rather than taking any randon content management system.
For this we can consider different things while deciding such as our need, our abilities
to use, security, available resources to name a few.



I can describe and compare content management systems.
------------------------------------------------------
I'm getting some ideas about how Hugo site is different from WordPress. Moreover,
I learned how different content managment system offers different functionalities.


I can manage content using established workflows.
-------------------------------------------------
This week I have work as a editor for my group. I learned how we can
write the effective post. Eventhough I'm working as an editor, I'm learning how 
an administrator and developer works.


I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
So far I have learned some stuffs in Hugo and some stuffs from WordPress. I can use 
these two sites to create post and publish content based on our need. I believe there is 
more to learn about WordPress to use it's full functionalities.


I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
--------------------------------------------------------
I have used different resources to learn about different stuffs about WordPress
such as YouTube videos, and WordPress related working sites.
